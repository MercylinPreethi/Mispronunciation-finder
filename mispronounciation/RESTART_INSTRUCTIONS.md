# How to Restart the App After New Component Addition

The new `EnhancedWordPracticeModal` component has been added. If the app won't load, follow these steps:

## 1. Clear Metro Bundler Cache

```bash
cd /workspace/mispronounciation

# Stop the current Expo server (Ctrl+C if running)

# Clear Metro cache
npx expo start --clear

# OR use one of these alternatives:
npm start -- --reset-cache
# OR
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
npx expo start
```

## 2. If that doesn't work, do a full clean:

```bash
# Clean cache and restart
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
rm -rf .expo
rm -rf $TMPDIR/metro-*
rm -rf $TMPDIR/haste-*

# Restart Expo
npx expo start --clear
```

## 3. If you still have issues, revert to the old modal temporarily:

The old modal code is preserved. You can temporarily comment out the new component and uncomment the old one in `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` around line 2505.

## 4. Check for specific errors:

Run the app with:
```bash
npx expo start
```

Then check the Metro bundler terminal output for any specific error messages.
