# Notification Throttling & Queue System

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:** Multiple notifications were sent simultaneously, overwhelming users with notification spam.

**After:** Intelligent notification queue with proper spacing, priority system, and duplicate prevention - just like professional apps (WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **Notification Queue System**

All notifications are added to a priority queue instead of being sent immediately:

```typescript
class NotificationQueue {
  - Queue with priority sorting (1-5, 5 = highest)
  - Intelligent spacing (minimum 30 seconds between notifications)
  - Duplicate detection (prevents same notification within X minutes)
  - Batch delays for low-priority notifications (2 minutes)
  - Automatic stale notification removal (>5 minutes old)
}
```

### 2. **Priority Levels**

Different notification types have different priorities:

| Priority | Level | Examples | Behavior |
|----------|-------|----------|----------|
| 5 | Critical | System alerts | Send ASAP |
| 4 | High | Streak milestones, Achievements | Send with 30s spacing |
| 3 | Medium | Mastery, Daily complete | Send with 30s spacing |
| 2 | Low | Accuracy improvements | Send with 2min spacing if batched |
| 1 | Lowest | Tips, Suggestions | Send with 2min spacing if batched |

### 3. **Timing Rules**

- **Minimum Interval**: 30 seconds between ANY notifications
- **Batch Delay**: 2 minutes between low-priority notifications
- **Duplicate Window**: Same notification won't send within 5-30 minutes (type-dependent)
- **Stale Threshold**: Notifications older than 5 minutes are discarded

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before Implementation:
```
User completes daily word:
├─ Daily complete notification (0ms)
├─ Mastery notification (0ms)
├─ Streak milestone notification (0ms)
└─ Achievement notification (0ms)
Result: 4 notifications at once! 😫
```

### After Implementation:
```
User completes daily word:
├─ Streak milestone queued (Priority 4)
├─ Daily complete queued (Priority 3)
├─ Mastery queued (Priority 3)
└─ Achievement queued (Priority 4)

Sent:
├─ Streak milestone (0:00) ⚡
├─ Achievement (0:30) ⚡
├─ Daily complete (1:00) ⚡
└─ Mastery (1:30) ⚡
Result: Spaced nicely! 😊
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Updated Functions

#### 1. `sendMotivationalNotification()`
**Before:**
```typescript
await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: { title, body, data },
  trigger: null, // Send immediately
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Check for duplicates
if (notificationQueue.isDuplicate(`motivational_${type}`, 10)) {
  return; // Skip if sent within 10 minutes
}

// Add to queue with priority
notificationQueue.enqueue({
  type: `motivational_${type}`,
  title,
  body,
  data,
  priority: 3, // Medium priority
});
```

#### 2. `scheduleAchievementNotification()`
**Before:** Sent immediately
**After:** 
- Queued with priority 4 (high)
- Duplicate check: 30 minutes
- Sent within 30 seconds of previous notification

#### 3. Queue Processing
```typescript
async processQueue() {
  while (queue.length > 0) {
    // Wait minimum interval (30s)
    await waitIfNeeded();
    
    // Get highest priority notification
    const notification = queue.shift();
    
    // Skip if too old (>5 minutes)
    if (isStale(notification)) continue;
    
    // Send notification
    await sendNotification(notification);
    
    // Add batch delay for low-priority
    if (lowPriority && hasMoreLowPriority) {
      await sleep(2 minutes);
    }
  }
}
```

## 📱 User Experience

### Example Scenario 1: Daily Word Completion

**User completes daily word at 7:00 PM:**

```
7:00:00 PM - User completes practice
7:00:00 PM - [Queued] Daily complete (P3)
7:00:00 PM - [Queued] Streak milestone: 7 days (P4)
7:00:00 PM - [Queued] Mastery achieved (P3)

7:00:00 PM - [Sent] 🔥 Streak milestone (Priority 4)
7:00:30 PM - [Sent] ✅ Daily complete (Priority 3)
7:01:00 PM - [Sent] ⭐ Mastery achieved (Priority 3)
```

### Example Scenario 2: Multiple Achievements

**User unlocks 3 achievements in quick succession:**

```
8:00:00 PM - [Queued] Achievement A (P4)
8:00:01 PM - [Queued] Achievement B (P4) - Duplicate check passes
8:00:02 PM - [Queued] Achievement C (P4) - Duplicate check passes

8:00:00 PM - [Sent] 🏆 Achievement A
8:00:30 PM - [Sent] 🏆 Achievement B
8:01:00 PM - [Sent] 🏆 Achievement C
```

### Example Scenario 3: Low Priority Batch

**Multiple accuracy improvements:**

```
9:00:00 PM - [Queued] Accuracy +5% (P2)
9:00:10 PM - [Queued] Accuracy +3% (P2)
9:00:20 PM - [Queued] Accuracy +2% (P2)

9:00:00 PM - [Sent] 📈 Accuracy +5%
9:02:00 PM - [Sent] 📈 Accuracy +3% (2min batch delay)
9:04:00 PM - [Sent] 📈 Accuracy +2% (2min batch delay)
```

## 🛡️ Duplicate Prevention

### How It Works:

```typescript
isDuplicate(type: string, withinMinutes: number): boolean {
  const cutoff = Date.now() - (withinMinutes * 60 * 1000);
  return queue.some(n => 
    n.type === type && n.timestamp > cutoff
  );
}
```

### Duplicate Windows:

| Notification Type | Window | Reason |
|-------------------|--------|--------|
| Daily complete | 10 min | Can only complete once per day |
| Streak milestone | 30 min | Milestones don't change frequently |
| Mastery | 10 min | Word mastery is one-time event |
| Achievement | 30 min | Achievements are rare |
| Accuracy improvement | 5 min | Can happen multiple times |

---

## 📊 Queue Status API

### Get Queue Status:
```typescript
const status = getNotificationQueueStatus();
console.log(status);
// {
//   queueLength: 3,
//   isProcessing: true,
//   lastNotificationTime: 1729234567890
// }
```

### Clear Queue:
```typescript
clearNotificationQueue();
// Useful for testing or user preference
```

### Check for Duplicates:
```typescript
const isDupe = wouldBeDuplicate('streak_milestone', 30);
if (!isDupe) {
  // Safe to send
}
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjustable Parameters:

```typescript
class NotificationQueue {
  private readonly MIN_INTERVAL = 30000; // 30 seconds
  private readonly BATCH_DELAY = 120000; // 2 minutes
  private readonly STALE_THRESHOLD = 300000; // 5 minutes
}
```

**To customize:**
1. Edit `services/notificationService.ts`
2. Modify the constants in `NotificationQueue` class
3. Save and rebuild

---

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Rapid Notifications
```typescript
// Send 5 notifications quickly
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  await sendMotivationalNotification('daily_complete', {});
}

// Expected: Only first one queued, others skipped (duplicates)
```

### Test Scenario 2: Priority Order
```typescript
await sendMotivationalNotification('accuracy_improvement', {}); // P2
await scheduleAchievementNotification('Test', 'desc'); // P4
await sendMotivationalNotification('streak_milestone', { streak: 7 }); // P4

// Expected order: P4 → P4 → P2 (highest priority first)
```

### Test Scenario 3: Queue Status
```typescript
const before = getNotificationQueueStatus();
console.log('Queue length:', before.queueLength);

await sendMotivationalNotification('daily_complete', {});

const after = getNotificationQueueStatus();
console.log('Queue length:', after.queueLength); // +1
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Scheduled Notifications (Daily Reminders):
**These are NOT affected by the queue.**
- Daily reminders use system scheduling
- Streak risk alerts use system scheduling
- Only instant notifications use the queue

### Queue Behavior:
- **Automatic**: Starts processing on first notification
- **Continuous**: Runs until queue is empty
- **Self-managing**: No manual intervention needed
- **Persistent**: Queue survives app minimization

### Edge Cases Handled:
✅ App closes while processing → Remaining notifications dropped
✅ Duplicate types → Filtered automatically
✅ Old notifications → Removed from queue
✅ High priority during batch → Interrupts batch delay

---

## 📈 Performance Impact

### Memory:
- **Queue overhead**: ~1KB per queued notification
- **Typical usage**: 1-3 notifications in queue
- **Max queue size**: Unlimited (but auto-clears stale)

### Processing:
- **CPU usage**: Minimal (event-based)
- **Battery impact**: Negligible (timers only)
- **Network**: None (local processing)

---

## 🔄 Migration

### No Code Changes Required!

The notification queue is **completely transparent** to existing code:

**Before:**
```typescript
await sendMotivationalNotification('daily_complete', {});
```

**After:**
```typescript
await sendMotivationalNotification('daily_complete', {});
// Same call, but now queued automatically!
```

**All existing code continues to work exactly the same.**
